# neurotische-netwerkjes

`main.py` implements the neural network described in `nnt1.m` in Python, with weights already stolen.
This is the basis for further work on NEAT.

To install required dependencies, run `sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Run with `python3 main.py`.

oh, and the function we implemented turns out to have been AND instead of XNOR because somebody made a typo.
